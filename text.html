        The summer went well. I found joy in the blur of subway cars, and films kept me company.
        <br><br>
        I have 8 months that I know I must not waste. I hate my own weakness. I am more.

        I fell in love with vaporwave in senior year of high school. Years later, it remains a personal fascination and obsession. At first it was just an innocent curiosity. I started where I think most people begin -- floral shoppe by macintosh plus, and other by-chance encounters on youtube. It also helped that one of my friends became a defining pillar of the sound. I know and recognize the original intent behind the phenomenon, but it was honestly never satirical for me. I really loved the music.
        <br><br>
        What makes it work is a genuine, inimitable yearning for the nonexistent. The genre samples music from the last century, so the nostalgia is already there. But to me it's different from hip-hop or house or other genres that sample because it's not trying to make something new and exciting from the past. Instead it submits to yesterday, it invites me to want something I never had: anemoia. While I hate when other genres "lazy-sample", I actually prefer it when vaporwave leaves the track mostly alone. It pays homage to the original song but forces it to live in the present, like a man out of time. Vaporwave is a time machine that bends reality - I'm listening to Diana Ross, city pop, and water level OSTs from '80s games, warped beyond recognition or sometimes just slowed a bit, playing in a fuzzy texture as if it's all a dream. Three songs into my playlist and I can almost believe I grew up pre-iPhone and social media hegemony.
        <br><br>
        It's a gateway drug too, the genre is by nature a transmitter more than anything so it begs you to explore the legends of yesterday, it screams at you to check out what the past sounds like un-slowed and un-manipulated.
        <br><br>
        But what vaporwave will be remembered for by future vaporologists is the culture. and here I urge to discard the original satirical intentions, because they are long forgotten and abandoned. those of us who have stayed behind don't listen to floral shoppe to applaud the caricaturization of capitalism. We flock to the reverb-gated snares and dreamy synths of the past to feel something. Vaporwave is an escape. It was an escape for me then, and it still is now.
