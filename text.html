        D, we never got to meet but you changed my ears. Thank you for what you gave us. I felt such a strong bond to your art in these past few weeks - I can't deny that it felt spiritual. I can't seem to listen to anyone else right now.
        <br><br>
        If there is an after, I hope you are preparing more of your magic for those of us still on this rock. Can I look forward to more with JayDee? Down here, you gave us enough to hold us down until the end. We always wanted more, by the way. But I know, even as a beginner, that that's not quite how it works with us.
        <br><br>
        Speak through me. I won't just imitate, I want to stoke the soul you shared with us. I admire you so much. I hope what I create has a fraction of the influence and meaning.

        The summer went well. I found joy in the blur of subway cars, and films kept me company.

        I fell in love with vaporwave in senior year of high school. Years later, it remains a personal obsession. I started where I think most people begin -- floral shoppe by macintosh plus, and other by-chance encounters on youtube. It also helped that one of my friends became a defining pillar of the sound. I know and recognize the original intent behind the phenomenon, but it was honestly never satirical for me. I really loved the music.
        <br><br>
        What makes it work is a genuine, inimitable yearning for the nonexistent. The genre samples music from the last century, so the nostalgia is already there. But to me it's different from hip-hop or house or other genres that sample because it's not trying to make something new and exciting from the past. Instead it submits to yesterday, it invites me to want something I never had: anemoia. While I hate when other genres "lazy-sample", I actually prefer it when vaporwave leaves the track mostly alone. It pays homage to the original song but forces it to live in the present, like a man out of time. Vaporwave is a time machine that bends reality - I'm listening to Diana Ross, city pop, and water level OSTs from '90s games, warped beyond recognition or sometimes just slowed a bit, playing in the fuzzy texture of a dream. Three songs into the playlist, I can almost believe that I grew up pre-iPhone and social media hegemony.
        <br><br>
        It's a gateway drug too, the genre is by nature a transmitter more than anything so it begs you to explore the legends of yesterday, it screams at you to check out what the past sounds like un-slowed and un-manipulated.
        <br><br>
        But what vaporwave will be remembered for by future vaporologists is the <i>feeling</i>. And here I urge you to discard the original satirical intentions, because they are long forgotten and abandoned. those of us who have stayed behind don't listen to floral shoppe to applaud the caricaturization of capitalism. We flock to the reverb-gated snares and dreamy synths of the past to feel something. Vaporwave is an escape. It was an escape for me then, and it still is now.
